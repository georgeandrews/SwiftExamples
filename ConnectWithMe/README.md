# Connect With Me - a Sample Project

You can download this project to follow along with me at the Chippewa Valley Dev Group on Tuesday, April 18, in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Together we'll review some tips and tricks for using breakpoints, use MARK comments to make our code easier to navigate, create a Build Phase script so we don't miss our FIXMEs and TODOs, and use Extensions to make it easier to use some common code snippets throughout our project.
